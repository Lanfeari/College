#This version of the code uses , as a way to add an argument to the print fuction, when ran it will print both arguments and use the default seperator.

#name = input("What is your name? ")
#print("Hello,",name)

#this version of the code uses + as a way to add arguments to the print fuction, when it runs it will conjoin two strings.

#name = input("What is your name? ")
#print("Hello," + name)

#We can decide what parameters the function should use if the default parameters don't fit our needs

#name = input("what is your name? ")
#print("Hello,",end="")
#print(name)

#We can use F-strings or formatted strings to call our variable within the string, we do this by using a f charcter outside the argument at the begining of a string
#name = input('What is your name? ')
#print(f'Hello,{name}')

#we can use methods to interact with our code and use string spesfic functions, This method strips the input of blank spaces.
#name = input('What is yoru name? ')
#name = name.strip()
#print('Hello,', name)

#We can use the method name.capatilse to capatlise the string
#name = name.capitalize()
#print('Hello,',name)

#we can add more than one method in the same line too save on code space 
#name = name.strip().title()
#print(f"Hello,{name}")

#we can save even moore space by writing the methods to work on the intial return value
#name = input('What is your name? ').strip().title()
#print(f'hello,{name}')

#we can use another method called split to control our output better. this will take a return string and break it up into substrings 
#name = input('What is your name? ') 
#first, last = name.split(" ")
#print(f'{first}')
