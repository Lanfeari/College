<!-- I found this very fun and enagaging, HTML seems extremely intresting in how it works and what it allows us to do
 the initial challange of calculations was informative. it gave me insight into how js code handles mathamatics,
 i had trouble in the begining with the "+" witch was just conceating the two inputted strings but i finally figured that out.
 after doing the intial requirements i wanted to see if i could get the 4 functions to be selectable and run from a dropwdown menu
 this was alot more diffcuilt that i expected and it's likely because i didn't know what question i was asking.
 my inital attempt involed a eventlistener function that executed whenever the dropdown menu changed witch was not ideal
 to get the function to only run when i pressed the button seemed hard but in the end the solution was infact simple.
 i will include a comment at the bottom containing some of these attemps and i look foward to going over this again in class
 i can't wait to find out how this is done elegantly and well.

<!-- Below this is all just notes on ,and the code for the other 2 solutions i was trying.-->

<!--
---------------This was some example code i was playing with to try and figure this out(from stack overflow)--------------------------------

<h>Would you like to see count values per hour or minute?</h><br>
<Select id="Selector">
   <option value="hr">Hour</option>
   <option value="min">Minute</option>
   
</Select>
<div id="Btn1">
  <p><input type="button" value="submit" onClick="addition();"></p>
  </div>
<script>
function addition(){
    var N1 = 0
    N1 = parseInt(prompt('What is the first number to add? ',0));
    var N2 = 0
    N2 = parseInt(prompt('what is the second number? ',0));
    var NT = 0
    var NT = N1 + N2;
    
    alert(NT)}
    </script>
<script>
const div = document.getElementById('Btn1');
  document.getElementById("Selector").onchange = changeListener;
  
    function changeListener(){
      var value = this.value
      console.log(value);
    
      if (value == "min"){
        div.innerhtml = '<p>input type="button" value="submit" onClick="</p>;'
        
    }
      else if (value == "hr"){
        document.body.style.background = "blue";
        return 20
    }
    
  }
</script>
-------------- As you can see if was playing with idea of returning a value and setting a var outside of the function 
it did not work and i gave up once i realised that there must be a better solution and that returning values from functions back
into HTML was beyond what i was trying to do --------------------------------------------

-------------This was the other solutuion i persued but i couldn't get this too work either--------------
<h>Would you like to see count values per hour or minute?</h><br>
<Select id="Selector">
   <option value="hr">Hour</option>
   <option value="min">Minute</option>
   
</Select>
<div id="Btn1">
  <p><input type="button" value="submit" onClick="addition();"></p>
  </div>
<script>
function addition(){
    var N1 = 0
    N1 = parseInt(prompt('What is the first number to add? ',0));
    var N2 = 0
    N2 = parseInt(prompt('what is the second number? ',0));
    var NT = 0
    var NT = N1 + N2;
    
    alert(NT)}
    </script>
<script>
const div = document.getElementById('Btn1');
  document.getElementById("Selector").onchange = changeListener;
  
    function changeListener(){
      var value = this.value
      console.log(value);
    
      if (value == "min"){
        div.innerhtml = '<p>input type="button" value="submit" onClick="</p>;'
        
    }
      else if (value == "hr"){
        document.body.style.background = "blue";
        return 20
    }
    
  }
</script>
-----------------------------------------was trying to rewrite the onclick property of the button whenever the value of the dropdown changed to corrospond
to the function i wanted--------------

These were the two main paths i looked at i was able to find the third and final solution.
this is very exciting and i can't wait to see where this can go.
